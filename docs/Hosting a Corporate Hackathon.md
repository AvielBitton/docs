# Overview

Creating a culture of innovation within any group or organization requires deliberate and continuous effort. One way to foster such a culture of innovation while bringing excitement and new ideas to an existing business problem is by running hackathons. Hackathons are events focused on short, intensive periods of implementation-heavy problem solving. Most often, the implementation calls for software development; however, the requested deliverables may vary.

The purpose of this White Paper is to provide a guide for teams within medium to large corporations who are interested in hosting a Hackathon and tapping into the great potential of global associates. The steps in this guide have been listed chronologically, in the recommended order of completion by the Hackathon Hosts.

# First Things First

There are several prerequisites to complete before you can properly start planning your hackathon:

1. **Pick a problem that can be easily encapsulated and defined.** Problem statements that are too vague or high level will result in confusion, limited participation, and solutions that are not in scope.  
2. **Ensure that solving this problem is important to the business.** Do not proceed without stakeholder/senior leader buy-in. This step is critical for funding the hackathon, gaining traction and support when recruiting participants, and ensuring that the effort to run the hackathon is worth the investment.

# Pick Your Team

Now that you have a problem that is hackathon-appropriate and leader-approved, you will need to identify who will play a role in the hackathon. Here is the suggested team structure:

1. **One Hackathon Leader.** Pick a single person to manage the logistics and people involved with the hackathon. This is the person who ensures that all steps in this guide are completed, all tasks are on schedule, and the person who acts as the “referee”. Hackathons are competitions after all, and this game-like environment means that there needs to be an unbiased person making the final call on rules and special cases. Therefore, this person should not also be acting as a judge, stakeholder, or participant.
2. **2+ Technical Experts.** Odds are the hackathon challenge will be technically complex. It will be important to have subject matter experts available when creating the problem statement, determining the submission format, acting as coaches for the teams, and even helping the judges understand the solutions. In most cases, it helps to have these technical experts act as judges as well.
3. **3-5 Anonymous Judges.** It is recommended not to share who the judges are, until the results are being announced. Having an odd number of judges helps with tie breakers, and keeping the count to 5 or less ensures that the judging process does not become unnecessarily lengthy. The ideal mix of judges tends to be 1-2 senior leaders, 1-2 technical experts, and 1-2 associates who are very familiar with the problem being solved (perhaps they will even be responsible for implementing the solutions).
4. **As many advocates as possible.** By advocates we mean those who will help you with marketing tasks, spread the word of your hackathon, or avid fans of hackathons in general. List all the advocates you can think of, and inform them of your plans once you have completed the “Create a Timeline” step.

# Pick Your Structure

The traditional hackathon is often run uninterrupted. For example, teams may have 48 hours straight to work on a solution over the weekend. The more common approach at Nielsen is to allot a longer period of time with the assumption that teams will work on the solution outside of regular working hours. Some hackathons may mix the two. They may have an open period of 2 weeks, but also host a 12 hour ‘final sprint’ on the last day, which may involve reserving space on a weekend and providing teams with help from experts and energy from free food. The team should select their preferred structure prior to proceeding to the next step.

# Pick Your Budget

The financial benefit of hackathons is that only the winning team (or select few teams) will receive a prize, yet the host of the hackathon can leverage all solutions that have been submitted. Since participation in hackathons is often done in addition to an associate’s regular work responsibilities, it will be important to ensure that the grand prize (or top prizes) are desirable enough to warrant the extra effort. Although there is no ideal amount, it is common to see monetary amounts starting at $1,000 for the winning team or individual. Additional, non-monetary prizes to highlight are leadership exposure, organization-wide recognition, and a chance to showcase skills for future career growth.
The biggest hidden cost to running a hackathon is the time taken from the hackathon team mentioned in the “Pick Your Team” section. Keeping this in mind will be important when considering the submission structure and judging process, to ensure that the team members can minimize time spent on reviewing submissions.

# Pick Your Rules

Clearly defined rules are critical to any hackathon. Of course, unique situations for which no rules have been created will come up. In those cases, the hackathon leader will determine the outcome. Here are some recommended topics to include in the rules:
* What is the acceptable team size?
* Is a one-person team acceptable?
* Can one person be on multiple teams?
* Are multiple entries per team acceptable?
* Can teams join during the hackathon, or is there a registration cut-off date?
* Who may participate? (i.e. a specific organization, all employees, external teams)
* Who is eligible for prizes (1st place only, Top 3, etc.), and what are they?
* What is the acceptable format for solution submission?

# Pick Your Tools

Picking the right set of tools can help ensure that the hackathon runs smoothly. For a larger hackathon with multiple rounds of judging, longer timelines, a large number of expected entries, and wider global reach, check to see if your corporation has a partnership with an enterprise innovation portal. These can provide a well-defined structure. For smaller hackathons that do not have the scale of the criteria listed above, the suite of Google products, if approved by your organization, is a fast option that allows direct creation and management of content. The following tools are recommended with this option:
* Team registration via Google Forms
* Communication forum and Q&A via Google Plus
* Broadcasted kick-off event via YouTube Live
* Solution submission via Google Forms
* Judging via Google Sheets (results from Google Forms feed there directly)

# Create a Timeline

Like any other project or initiative, the hackathon will need a detailed timeline in order to stay on track. The following tasks and durations are recommended in the timeline:
* 1-2 weeks to create documents required for the hackathon. These include:
    * Background information about your business area
    * Detailed information about the problem statement
    * Creation of an environment (or a process) for teams to test their submissions
    * Registration and submission forms
    * Marketing posters and communications
* 1-2 weeks to advertise/market the hackathon and kick-off event
* 1 day to hold the 1 hour kickoff event
* 2-3 weeks for teams to work on solutions
* 1-2 weeks for judging
* 1 week to determine total impact of the event, procure the prizes, and determine next steps
* 1 day to hold the 1 hour closing ceremony and announce the winners

# Get the Word Out

For marketing the hackathon, the recommended approach is to target as many channels as possible. Based on prior events, the following represent the general effort and impact of various marketing avenues:

HIGH IMPACT/LOW EFFORT
* Calendar invite added to all associate calendars
* Personal email from senior leader encouraging participation

HIGH IMPACT/HIGH EFFORT
* Flyer dropped on every desk in the office
* Direct 1-on-1 contact to encourage participation

LOW IMPACT/LOW EFFORT
* Inclusion in a newsletter to all associates
* Requesting managers to cascade information

LOW IMPACT/HIGH EFFORT
* Posters printed and hung around the building

# Kick it off in Person

Having an in-person kick-off event is a great way to build excitement and answer important questions about the hackathon logistics and challenge problem(s). If your hackathon audience is global or spans across multiple offices, be sure to broadcast this event and make it remote-friendly (i.e. have a designated person monitor questions online during the event). Here is a common agenda for a kick-off event:
1. **Introduction**: Try to have the hackathon sponsor/senior leader open the event
2. **Agenda**: Try to keep all topics covered to span no more than 45 minutes
3. **Why**: Review the business problem or current state of the situation to show why the hackathon is taking place
4. **What**: Review what the teams should be trying to accomplish
5. **How**: Review how the teams can test and submit their solutions
6. **Rules**: Mention the person who will make final decisions for special cases
7. **Timeline**: List specific times (with timezone) to eliminate confusion for global teams
8. **Q&A**: As a tip, discuss the hackathon ahead of time with associates who are from your team, to see what type of questions may come up

# Keep the Excitement Going

There are several ways to keep the participants engaged for hackathons that span over several weeks:
1. **Dedicated time with SMEs**: Teams may be participating from a variety of organizations and have no prior exposure to your business area. Offer time with SMEs within 1-2 days of the kickoff, which will allow teams to review the content and come up with initial questions, as well as 1-2 times per week until the deadline.
2. **Open hours**: To channel the true spirit of a hackathon, offer a designated time and location for teams to work on their solutions. This may be a lunch hour, an afternoon, or a full day where teams can come and go as their schedules permit. As an added bonus, you can overlap this with the dedicated SME time by having the right people in the room, and offering snacks and drinks throughout.
3. **Mini-Contests**: If the timeline allows for it, there can be smaller milestones set throughout the hackathon. For example, if the hackathon requires a specific set up that may take the participants extra time, the hackathon team can encourage teams to get past this step quickly by giving a reward to all teams who are set up within 24 hours of the launch. This reward need not be monetary. It could be an extra hour with a SME, or being the first to select a time slot for a testing environment or shared hardware.

# Judging

Having a well-structured submission format, and pre-defined judging criteria are very important in keeping the judging period on schedule. An often overlooked hurdle is that the judges will inherently be busy individuals. Therefore, judging expectations should be shared before any judge is selected. The following is a sample judging process:
1. **Initial review by the hackathon leader**: After the deadline passes, the hackathon leader should go through all entries to ensure that they qualify. This will ensure that the judges do not waste time on submissions that are not eligible to win.
2. **Offline reviews by judges**: Depending on the number of entries, each judge may be asked to review all entries, or the entries may be split equally between judges. During the offline review period, judges will fill in scores for the pre-defined judging criteria, as well as specific comments for the other judges.
3. **Hackathon leader reviews results**: After the judges have reviewed their designated entries, the hackathon leader should review the judging sheet and organize the entries. Often, there are a few entries that are clear finalists, and others that are not. This initial filtering will help focus the judges in the next step.
4. **In-person discussion**: The hackathon leader should schedule and facilitate an in-person (or face-to-face over videoconferencing) meeting with the judges. For a hackathon with multiple rounds, this will just be the first round. For a smaller hackathon, this will be to select the winners.
5. **Final confirmation**: If the sponsor or senior leader of the hackathon is not a judge, share the final results with him or her for final confirmation.

# Sharing Outcomes

Sharing the results of the hackathon is another opportunity to build excitement and promote a culture of innovation. If possible, have another event to announce the winners, and have the sponsor or senior leader make the announcement and hand out the prizes. Even if the prize is monetary, it is recommended to have a physical plaque or certificate to hand out at the event.

After the live announcement, publicize the winning teams and their solution across newsletters and Google Plus. This not only celebrates the winners and gives them exposure, but also spreads the solution to teams that may also have a use for it.

Finally, it is important to have a meeting with the sponsor and stakeholders to determine the impact of the hackathon. Prior to this meeting, the impact of the winning solution as well as other useful solutions should be quantified, and the hackathon team should have created a plan and timeline for implementing next steps. These next steps could include additional follow ups from the solution teams, a strategy to integrate the solution with an existing product, or a plan to implement a new product entirely.

# Conclusion

Hosting a hackathon can be a time-consuming endeavor. However, with the right planning and support, the impact can be tremendous. These events can help identify associates and ideas across the company who have the skills needed to solve some of the organization's largest business problems. Winning solutions for one area of the business often come from a completely different business group. Such opportunities to connect teams and channel new perspectives are what make hackathons such valuable tools for innovation and collaboration.
